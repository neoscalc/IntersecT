    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase diagrams calculated using forward thermodynamic modelling allow users to determine the pressure (*P*) and temperature (*T*) conditions of mineral assemblage formation for a given bulk composition (*X*). In the last decade, several software solutions have provided quantitative approaches where optimal *P–T* conditions can be calculated from a statistical point of view, resulting in more accurate interpretation of forward model results (e.g., the quality factor implemented in Bingo-Antidote; Duesterhoeft & Lanari, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1111/jmg.12538).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the quality factor of the composition (hereby **Qcmp**) as described in Duesterhoeft & Lanari (2020) is applied to thermodynamic model results from both **Perple_X** (WERAMI output) and **MAGEMin**. The Qcmp allows the propagation of uncertainties in the measured mineral composition. In addition, IntersecT applies a reduced chi-squared statistics to assess the weight of the considered phases. This allows for the down-weighting of outlier data, whether due to model problems or incorrect assumptions, including disequilibrium features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation uses standardized mineral nomenclature following Warr (2021, https://doi.org/10.1180/mgm.2021.43) and automatically handles phase name resolution from software-specific abbreviations. Solid solution phases are discriminated where appropriate based on compositional criteria.\n",

The weighted result should generally be preferred as it accounts for the statistical reliability of different phases, but significant discrepancies between weighted and unweighted estimates warrant careful scrutiny of individual phase matches and potential sources of systematic error."
